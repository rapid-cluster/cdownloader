CDownloader: Cluster Science Archive (CSA) downloading tool

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To compile this software, one needs:
1. A C++ compiler with C++11 support
2. CMake (www.cmake.org), version 3.6.0 or greater
3. LibCURL (curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) (not tested with versions older than 7.52.1)
4. CDF library (cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/), version 3.6.2.1 or greater

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The shortest way to compile cdownloader:

mkdir build-dir
cd build-dir
cmake ..
make

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring

Only out-of-source builds are supported. Create build directory either outside of the source tree or
as a subdir in the source tree. cd to that directory and run cmake <source directory>, possibly
supplying one or more options (see below the options list). For this example we will create the build
directory inside of the source directory:

cd <source directory>
mkdir build

and cd into it:

cd build

Now we are ready to run configure phase. This is done via the following command:

cmake <source directory> [-D<option1_name>=<option1_value> [-D<option2_name>=<option2_value>] ...]

In out example the command without options is:

cmake ..

To get list of available options, run:

cmake -LH ..

which is somewhat equivalent to 'configure --help' with autotools. To extend this list with CMake
predefined variables, run

cmake -LAH ..

If configure phase completes successfully, you can move to the next phase, compiling. Otherwise you
need to correct configure errors first, that are most likely caused by an absent package.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling

If you did not specify a generator for CMake (run 'cmake -G' to get the list of available generators),
CMake uses its default generator to produce standard makefiles. Now you can run

make

or nmake on Windows in the build dir to compile the code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Installation

With the default generator (makefiles) to install the software run

make install

or DESTDIR=<destination directory> make install

Prefix '/usr/local' or 'c:\Program Files\' is used by. To change it, pass option CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
during configure phase:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
